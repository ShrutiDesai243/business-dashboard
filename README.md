## 🧠 Scraping Approach

* Multiple CSV files were generated from scraping different sources
* Combined using Python (Pandas)
* Removed duplicates and cleaned missing values
* Standardized fields like city and source

## 🔌 API Endpoints

* `/api/listings` → Get all listings
* `/api/total-listings` → Get total count
* `/api/by-city` → Aggregation by city
* `/api/by-source` → Aggregation by source
